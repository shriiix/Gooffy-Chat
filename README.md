2. Install required dependencies:


## How It Works
--------------
### Bot Conversation System
The application uses several mechanisms to create natural conversations:

1. Pattern matching for user messages
2. Context extraction to understand user intent
3. Product-specific knowledge base
4. Personality-driven responses
5. Automated bot-to-bot conversations
6. User state tracking for contextual follow-ups

### Conversation Types
1. Casual chat between bots
2. Product debates and comparisons
3. Product feature discussions
4. Weekend plans involving products
5. Product support conversations
6. Tech trend discussions
7. Customer experience sharing
8. Product rumors and speculation

## Customization Options
-----------------------
### Adding New Products
To add new products, edit the `products` list in app.py with details including:
- ID, name, tagline, description
- Features, price, pros, cons
- Rating, release date, colors

### Creating New Bot Personas
To add new bot personalities, extend the `bot_personas` list with:
- Name, emoji, personality traits
- Conversation style and role
- Quirks and favorite products
- Catchphrases and greeting styles

### Modifying Conversation Patterns
Conversation patterns can be extended in the `casual_conversation_patterns` and `product_qa_templates` lists.

## Files and Structure
---------------------
- app.py: Main application file with server logic and bot behavior
- templates/chat.html: Frontend interface and client-side logic
- README.txt: This documentation file

## Dependencies
--------------
- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Flask-SocketIO
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

## Notes
-------
- The WebSocket connection is configured for localhost by default
- For production deployment, additional configuration would be needed
- The application uses simulated product data; in a real environment, this would connect to a database

## Future Enhancements
---------------------
- Database integration for product information
- User accounts and authentication
- Multi-room chat support
- Voice and image message support
- Integration with actual e-commerce systems
- Mobile app version
